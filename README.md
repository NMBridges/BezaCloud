# BezaCloud
Beza Cloud is an application to help manage your AWS EC2 servers.

Use the npm instructions in the info.txt file to build the installer executable. Once built, go to the 'build' folder on Windows (may be different on Mac) and run the installer. If you would like a license key in order to use the program, please email bridges@gatech.edu (license keys are currently free).

Alternatively, download the pre-compiled installer here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/171NCg_yTFXhHigYMOBxzvwUd7rnXLED8/view?usp=sharing
Note: some code in this GitHub will not work properly without modification (for security reasons). Using this pre-compiled installer will install a working version of Beza Cloud. If you are interested in contributing to Beza Cloud, please contact bridges@gatech.edu for information on how to replace code such that development versions will run.
