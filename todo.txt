- Pull License Key IP server
- Pull AMI + CPU types

Add manually inputting passwords

Add option to disable cost pulling

Pull user's AMIs, add any cached AMIs that aren't theirs, load them to new server window.


Instead of prebuilt AMIs, give the option for basic windows platform, then you can
save your servers to AMIs
- Note: need to solve random password problem. Perhaps basic windows platform is not
    pure basic, it is an AMI that is already created

Close all the way if no tasks

Servers overlays
    When there is no password, must be manual
    When there is a password and it is on Mac
    When the user wants to make a new server
    When the user tries to connect to a server
        too soon
