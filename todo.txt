Instead of prebuilt AMIs, give the option for basic windows platform, then you can
save your servers to AMIs
- Note: need to solve random password problem. Perhaps basic windows platform is not
    pure basic, it is an AMI that is already created
- Logic:
    Pulls Templates on startup, those will be used in New Server window until
    the user loads up the My Templates window. Every time that window is opened,
    the New Server window's Templates will be updated

Close all the way if no tasks
